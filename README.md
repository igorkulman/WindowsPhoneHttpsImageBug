# Windows Phone HTTPS image loading bug
A sample app demonstrating a bug when displaying images server over HTTPS makes Windows Phone 8.1 completely hang.

The solution contains a Windows Phone 8 project and a Windows Phone 8.1. Both apps suffer from the sample problem, but the problem is worse in the Silverlight app. This makes me think that this is a Windows Phone 8.1 bug, independent on the Windows Phone SDK version.

Here is a video showing the problem: https://vimeo.com/138747871
